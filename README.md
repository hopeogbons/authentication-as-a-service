# Authentication-as-a-Service

Authentication as a Service (AaaS) is a cloud-based solution offering secure user or system verification methods, such as passwords and biometric checks. It allows organizations to deploy advanced authentication without managing their own infrastructure, reducing costs and complexity. AaaS scales easily, enhances security, and simplifies user access with features like single sign-on (SSO). It supports compliance and is utilized across various industries for secure online resource access.
